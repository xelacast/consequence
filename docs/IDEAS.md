The app that lets you see your wellbeing

What apps measure your wellebeing? I see habit trackes and calorie intake systems to track what you are doing. What about if what you are doing is actually working for you? There is weight trackers but what about a mental health tracker where you can receive feedback from yourself over a week, month, quarter, yearly. And to have an AI tap into your data to give you appropriate metrics and insights of what is working and what is not.

Everyone wants to live a better life and change themselves, but how do they know if what they are doing to better themselves, what they are changing about themselves is actually working to help their well being? There mental health, physical health, and fullfillment in life. I want people to lead more fullfilling lives and know what they are doing and how it is impacting them!

Consequence, know what affects you.

Supplement tracking for physical and mental health. Future updates turn it into a essential nutrients tracker and macro tracker. Claim is Nutrients are one of the pillars of health for a healthy brain. Misinformation has been going on for too long. We need to help people get their livdes togother.
